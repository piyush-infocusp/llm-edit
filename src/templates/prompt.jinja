Write a clear and enhanced version of the given text. Use the following guidelines for edits:

1. **Add New Content**: Use `<insert [id]>[new content]</insert>` to add examples or additional sentences where indicated. For instance:
   - `<insert 1>For example, drinking water, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding processed foods are effective ways to improve nutrition.</insert 1>`
   
2. **Remove Existing Content**: Use `<insert [id]>[content to remove]</delete>` to delete phrases or sentences where specified. For example:
   - `<delete 2>good for overall well-being</delete 2>`

3. **Replace Content**: Combine **delete** and **insert** tags to replace a phrase with more detailed information. For example:
   - `<delete 2>good for overall well-being</delete 2><insert 2>essential for improving immune function, energy levels, and mental clarity.</insert 2>`

4. **no edit associated with the task**: Use `<noedit [id]>[Reason]<noedit>` to indicate that no edit is required for a specific task. For example:
   - `<noedit 3>[No search text found]</noedit>`

5. If you want to insert newlines please do it withing <insert> tags. Ensure output doc is grounded onto the input doc.

### ID-to-Task Linking:
- **What is it?**: Each unique ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3) in the `<insert [id]>` and `<insert [id]>` tags corresponds directly to a task or instruction.
- **How it works**: The IDs link the edits in the text to the instructions provided, ensuring every task is accounted for.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Clarity**: IDs make it easy to trace edits back to their original instructions.
  - **Order**: Multiple edits in the same text are easily distinguishable by their IDs.
  - **Automated Processing**: IDs allow systems to process edits programmatically, linking edits to instructions or workflows.
  - **Review and Feedback**: IDs help reviewers refer to specific changes during discussions or approvals.

### Example of Task-to-ID Mapping:
#### Tasks:
- ID 1. Add examples of healthy eating habits to illustrate good nutrition.
- ID 2. Replace "good for overall well-being" with a more detailed description.
- ID 3. Add a concluding sentence emphasizing the importance of taking small, sustainable steps toward better nutrition.
- ID 4. If the doc mentions about heart health, please add a point about LDL and HDL.
